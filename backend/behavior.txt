- Attempts to search sometimes and answer based off that instead of combining with its knowledge. We want the LLM to use what it 
learns from its tool calls (especially searching online or on spotify) in conjunction with its current knowledge
- It doesn't really know what to do when you say stuff like "Can you solve this?" (look at my screen) or "Tell me more about the 
song I'm listening to" (Check out what's playing on my spotify). Maybe give more direct instructions 
to help it infer what the user wants it to do
